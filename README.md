Persecution Road is a project done in partnership with ReleaseInternation.org. It comprises of a 35-day prayer journey along the old Silk Road routes. Many of the countries that were on the old Silk Road are actually perpetrators of persecution against Christians today, from China through Central Asia, to Azerbaijan and Iran.
